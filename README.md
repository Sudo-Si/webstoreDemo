Hello World, 

Thanks for stopping by, here is a project that I am currently working on.



I do 3d printing in my spare time and wanted to have a place to showoff and sell the cool 3d prints i have found or made.
and as awesome as some platforms are... i am a developer , so why not create a store from scratch, leverageing JAM stack?
so I did.
I will make another version at some point as this one won't let me deploy yet 


App is working !!! here are some images of the pages and components
